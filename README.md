# Note about Measure.py and Generate_Samples.py
These files are the algorithms for measuring algorithmic bias and generating data points for Fair-SMOTE.
There are some small changes: adding a seed for reproducibility and generate column labels.
These are derived from the GitHub repository of github.com/joymallac/Fair-SMOTE and from the papers of Chakraborty et al. (2021) Algorithmic Bias in Software? Why? How?.
